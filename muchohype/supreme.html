<h3>Supreme X Louis Vuitton Hoodie ($1500)</h3>

<p>You think I'm kidding about the $1500.  No.  Supreme collabs with LV actually cost that much.  I don't know why people pay for this stuff it's rediculous.</p>

<p>This is actually pretty cool and 350 is on the cheap end of supreme items.  It's actually worth it to purchase some supreme clothing if you're looking to resell for hundreds in profit.  If you're buying their stuff to keep and look like a hypebeast... you prob have an IQ of &lt;100</p>

<h3>Supreme Hat ($45)</h3>
<p>About a 50% chance this is real, but what could possibly go wrong</p>

<p class="footer">This is the Supreme catalog containing the newer hype pieces that have recently come in.  Make sure to cop whatever you can before the items run out.  It's important to click on all of the buy buttons if you really want to buy the items.  Each includes a link to an external seller if our stock has already sold out.  I know it doesn't sound like the best business plan, but our primary goal is to help you become a true hypebeast and not to take your money :)  </p>
